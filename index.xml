I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time so focused on the lower-level web chals, but it felt like a solid intermediate to hard CTF with great difficulty and category distribution. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have any OSINT or forensics though :(

We were lagging behind other schools with no existing LMS, but this was a blessing in disguise - we werenâ€™t locked into a non-compliant vendor.
Time was running out, so Microsoft Teams was chosen to become a short-term repository/learning management system. Nothing is cheaper than free (so I was told), and the SharePoint backend would be easy to migrate if/when needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
